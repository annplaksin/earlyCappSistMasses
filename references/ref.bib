@article{Brauner.1982,
 abstract = {Johannes Parvus was the principal scribe of polyphony for the Papal chapel (Cappella Sistina) from ca. 1535 to 1580. His work included all or part of twenty-six choirbooks made for the Cappella Sistina, the Cappella Giulia (the chapel at St. Peter's), S. Maria Maggiore in Rome, and the cathedral seminary in Lucca. The books contain roughly fifty Masses, one hundred and thirty motets, two sets of Vespers Hymns, three cycles of Magnificats and other individual liturgical works: one of the largest, most significant repertories of the sixteenth century. The composers represented in the repertory are primarily those associated with the Papal chapel--Costanzo Festa, Morales, Arcadelt and Palestrina--or those of wide international reputation, such as Josquin, Mouton and Jacquet of Mantua.

Parvus dated relatively few of his copies; his books, moreover, are constructed in such a way as to allow a single volume to contain material from widely differing periods. A reliable chronology, however, can be achieved by correlating various sorts of external evidence--dated entries, archival data, heraldry, paper, format and page layout--with the readily perceptible changes in Parvus's script over his long career. In this manner, it has been possible to assign any page in his output to a period of no more than five to ten years. In addition, a study of the readings of the works Parvus copied establishes that the scribe had access to varied exemplars for his repertory, sometimes copying a single piece from more than one source on different occasions. In some instances the exemplars can be positively identified.

On the basis of the chronology, it is possible to chart the transformation of the repertory of the Papal chapel as it changed from a major Renaissance musical institution at the beginning of Parvus's career to a bastion of conservatism and classicism in the early 1560s, and finally to a revitalized center of post-Tridentine reform. The developments in the repertory coincide with the changes in attitudes of the Church and the Papacy toward music during the entire Counter-Reformation period.},

@article{Dean.1984,
 abstract = {This is a study of the manuscripts of sacred polyphony prepared at the scriptorium of the Sistine Chapel in the early sixteenth century. These are the MSS Cappella Sistina 16, 23, 26, 41, 42, 44, 45, 46, 49, 55, and 63, and Capella Giulia XII.2 (all in the Vatican Library), and the Medici Codex (now in the Biblioteca Laurenziana in Florence). These manuscripts (except for the Medici Codex) are composites of independent $\backslash$dq containing one or a very few pieces, later assembled into volumes. The manuscripts therefore are not of unitary date, and the alternation of scribes within the manuscripts is extremely complex. In the first chapter I present the archival evidence for the personnel of the Sistine scriptorium, identifying three scribes as likely to have contributed to the manuscripts under investigation. I then discuss manuscript structure and the copying process, and conclude the chapter with an exposition of my method of scribal analysis: how I classify and distinguish the hands of the several scribes (for they never sign their work), and how I may determine a chronology of their activity. Chapters 2-5 are devoted in turn to the scribes in chronological order: Johannes Orceau (active 1501-1512), Claudius Gellandi (ca. 1511-ca. 1521), four anonymous scribes associated with Gellandi (ca. 1518-ca. 1520), and Claudius Bouchet (ca. 1521-1527). Each copyist poses different problems of identification and chronology, requiring further development of methodology. These chapters are copiously illustrated with photographs and exhaustive charts of the alphabetic and musical characters used by each scribe. In Chapter 6 I investigate the foreign hands (correctors and annotators) in the manuscripts. This gives rise to digressions on text underlay and the history of the musical repertory of the Sistine choir. Chapter 7 is a detailed presentation of the conclusions of my study: a piece-by-piece catalogue of each manuscript. In Chapter 8 I present, as a guide to future research, a discussion of the value of scribal analysis to problems of textual criticism. Many individual pieces of music are discussed in the course of the dissertation.},

@article{Rodin.2007,
 abstract = {My dissertation takes as its point of departure the recent upheavals in Josquin scholarship. With the composer's date of birth pushed substantially forward, the fading importance of his Milanese period, and dozens of lingering questions with regard to authorship, there is an urgent need to reassess Josquin's compositional development. Crucially, the Sistine Chapel now looks like the place where some of the most exciting developments in Josquin's career occurred, correcting the earlier notion that these took place in Milan. In particular, Josquin composed a series of polyphonic mass settings while in Rome, music so famous that it was published in the first ever single-author music print. But those masses were not composed in a vacuum. While in Rome, Josquin sang newly acquired music from lavish papal manuscripts and worked alongside prominent singer-composers. Through study of Josquin's pre-Roman music, an exhaustive analysis of the papal chapel's repertory, and a stylistic comparison of masses by Josquin and his contemporaries, my dissertation addresses the following questions: Given the new biographical picture, how did Josquin develop as a composer? To what extent was he influenced by the music of his $\backslash$dq analysis of contrapuntal construction at the local level. Chief among my findings is the revelation that Josquin's mass music is in fact distinguishable from that of his contemporaries because of his obsessive compositional personality: more than anyone else, Josquin takes fragmentary musical ideas and spreads them densely across the entire texture by means of ostinato and other repetitive devices. Another important finding relates to Josquin's colleagues in Rome, particularly to Marbrianus de Orto (d. 1529). Not only is de Orto's music far more compelling than has been acknowledged, but Josquin seems to have borrowed a number of compositional techniques from de Orto, incorporating them into his Roman masses. Such findings lead to an unfamiliar conclusion: that Josquin engaged with and learned from the music he sang in Rome. They also make it possible for the first time to acknowledge the impressive contributions of composers like de Orto both to the genre of the polyphonic mass and to Josquin's compositional development more generally.},
